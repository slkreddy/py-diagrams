# py-diagrams

Lets start working on incredible Python's offering for designers that enables us programmatically create architecture diagrams. 

The first requirement to get started with building some of these diagrams is having Python 3.6 or higher installed. Once this is the case you will need to install GraphViz as this is what renders the diagrams. Once you have installed the library “diagrams” with your favorite Python package manager you are ready to start creating.

Start with executing 
CMD>> python diagram-simple.py

Happy designing!
